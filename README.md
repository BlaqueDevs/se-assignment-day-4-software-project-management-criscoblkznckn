Use Agile methodologies for iterative progress.
Set realistic timelines with buffer periods.
Monitor progress through project management tools like Jira or Trello.
Identify and mitigate risks early.
Maintain clear communication between stakeholders.

How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

ANSWER: Cost control ensures that a project remains financially viable, preventing losses. Strategies include:

Detailed budgeting to estimate costs accurately.
Regular monitoring of expenses against projections.
Scope management to prevent feature creep.
Agile development to adjust priorities without waste.
Negotiating vendor contracts for cost efficiency.

Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

ANSWER: Methodology	Advantages and Disadvantages
Agile	- Advantages: Flexible, iterative, allows quick adjustments, continuous feedback	Disadvantages: Requires strong collaboration, less predictable budget/timeline
Waterfall	- Advantages: Clear structure, well-defined scope, easier documentation Disadvantages:	Rigid, difficult to adapt to changes, potential late-stage failures

In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

ANSWER: Agile: Best for dynamic projects where requirements may change. Example: Developing a social media app where user feedback drives updates.
Waterfall: Ideal for projects with fixed requirements. Example: Building an enterprise payroll system where changes are minimal.

What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

ANSWER: Methods include:

Automated and manual testing (unit, integration, system testing).
Code reviews and peer programming.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
Maintaining quality ensures software reliability, security, and user satisfaction.

How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

ANSWER: Clear project scope prevents scope creep and sets clear deliverables.
WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of tasks, making complex projects more manageable. It helps in resource allocation and scheduling.

What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

ANSWER: Benefits include:

Improved resource allocation.
Clearer deadlines and dependencies.
Reduced risk of missed milestones.
Gantt charts visually map timelines, dependencies, and progress, aiding in tracking tasks efficiently.
